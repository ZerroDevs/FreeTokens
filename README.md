FreeTokens shows your Freebuff hours, session timers and measured token usage, with estimated
dollar costs at public API rates. On macOS it's a native menu bar app; on Windows it's a tray
popover; on Linux and the BSDs it's a system tray icon; everywhere it's also a command-line tool.
Token usage is measured from Freebuff and from the local history of the Antigravity app, Antigravity
IDE, the Agy CLI, Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode.

> **Unofficial.** FreeTokens is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Freebuff,
> Codebuff or CodebuffAI. It only reads your own usage with your existing Freebuff login.

## What it shows

| Row | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Daily Hours** – hours left in today's free pool and when it resets | Freebuff session endpoint (read-only GET) |
| **Hours Balance** – your separate wallet, in whole hours (5 Freebucks = 1 hour) | same |
| **Monthly Spend** – when Freebuff reports USD | same |
| **Session timers** – time left on each active session, in the menu bar title on macOS and in the tooltip elsewhere | same |
| Legacy **Daily / Weekly / Monthly / 5-Day / Premium** session windows on older accounts | same |
| **Today / Yesterday / Week / Last 30 Days** tokens per model and by source, with estimated cost | Freebuff hosted run history, Freebuff Desktop's local history, and Antigravity app, IDE, Agy CLI, Claude, Codex and OpenCode local history |

The usage panel groups by **Tool** (the model row as measured, with the tool that ran it) or by
**Provider** (the company serving the model), and the donut, its legend and the breakdown all follow
that choice. Provider grouping keeps a Claude Code, Codex or OpenCode session running another
provider's model attributed to that provider. The per-source totals sit under the chart in both cases.

Token counts are measured receipts, never estimates. Dollar figures are **estimates at public API
prices** (the [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models) model list and the OpenUsage
pricing supplement), not what Freebuff charges you. A total marked `≥` is a lower bound: some
tokens belong to a model with no public price, or some runs have no complete receipt yet.

## Install

Everything is on the [Releases](https://github.com/tverma101/FreeTokens/releases/latest) page.
Each release lists SHA-256 sums in `checksums.txt`.

### macOS (menu bar app)

1. Download `FreeTokens-<version>-macOS.zip` (one app for Apple silicon and Intel, macOS 13 or later).
2. Open the zip and drag **FreeTokens.app** into **Applications**.
3. Open FreeTokens. Releases aren't notarized yet, so the first launch is blocked. Go to
   **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway**, or run this once:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/FreeTokens.app
   ```

4. Click the FreeTokens icon in the menu bar. Turn on **Settings → Start at Login** to keep it running.

If the menu bar is full, macOS may hide the icon; check **System Settings → Menu Bar**. Opening
FreeTokens again from Finder or Spotlight always shows the panel (at the top right of the screen
when the icon is hidden).
Right-click the icon for **Refresh Now**, **Settings** and **Quit**.

The app includes the command-line tool. To use it from a terminal:

```bash
sudo ln -s /Applications/FreeTokens.app/Contents/Helpers/freetokens /usr/local/bin/freetokens
```

### Windows

Download `freetokens_<version>_windows_amd64.zip` (or `arm64` / `386`) and extract it to a folder
such as `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\FreeTokens`. It holds two copies of the same program:
`freetokens.exe` for the command line, and `freetokensw.exe`, which opens the popover without a
console window. Double-click `freetokensw.exe` (or run `freetokens.exe` with no arguments) and the
popover appears above the notification area; right-click the tray icon for **Refresh Now**,
**Settings** and **Exit**, and turn on **Settings → Start with Windows**. Windows may hide new tray icons under the **^** arrow; drag the icon onto the
taskbar to keep it visible. SmartScreen may warn on first launch because releases aren't
code-signed yet; choose **More info → Run anyway**.

### Linux and BSD

Download the archive for your platform, extract `freetokens` somewhere on your `PATH`, and run
`freetokens` from your desktop session to start the tray. The builds are pure Go with no system
libraries, so the CLI also works on servers. The tray needs a desktop with StatusNotifierItem
support: KDE, or GNOME with the AppIndicator extension, Xfce, Cinnamon, and others.

| OS | Architectures |
| --- | --- |
| macOS 13+ app | Universal (Apple silicon and Intel) |
| macOS 12+ CLI | `arm64`, `amd64` |
| Windows 10+ | `amd64`, `arm64`, `386` |
| Linux | `amd64`, `arm64`, `armv6`, `armv7`, `386`, `riscv64`, `ppc64le`, `s390x`, `loong64` |
| FreeBSD | `amd64`, `arm64` |
| OpenBSD | `amd64`, `arm64` |
| NetBSD | `amd64` |

The macOS CLI archives (`freetokens_<version>_darwin_<arch>.tar.gz`) are still published for
terminal-only use. After extracting one, clear the quarantine flag with
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./freetokens`.

Windows archives include the popover UI. Linux and BSD archives keep the CGO-free classic tray, so
the same download also works on a server; see [Build from source](#build-from-source) for the
Linux popover.

The Windows popover is pure Go and uses the WebView2 runtime that ships with Windows 11 (Edge
installs it on Windows 10). The Linux popover is a cgo build against GTK 3 and WebKit2GTK; the
Linux/BSD CLI and classic tray stay pure Go. The tray needs a desktop with StatusNotifierItem
support: KDE, or GNOME with the AppIndicator extension, Xfce, Cinnamon, and others.

A Linux AppImage works too: **Start at Login** points the autostart entry at the `.AppImage` file
rather than at the temporary mount it runs from, and updating hands off to the Releases page,
because an AppImage's read-only mount can't be replaced while it runs.

### From source

With Go 1.26+:

```bash
go install github.com/tverma101/FreeTokens/cmd/freetokens@latest
```

`go install` builds without the popover and gives you the CLI plus the classic tray.

To build the macOS menu bar app (needs Xcode): `scripts/build-macos-app.sh` writes
`dist-app/FreeTokens.app`.

## Build from source

The popover frontend is embedded at compile time, so build it before the Go binary. Node 22+ is
required, plus GTK/WebKit headers on Linux. This builds the Windows and Linux popover; macOS
ships the SwiftUI app above, and the popover there is not part of a release.

```bash
npm --prefix cmd/freetokens/web ci
npm --prefix cmd/freetokens/web run build
go build -tags "gui production" ./cmd/freetokens
```

The `production` tag is required: without it Wails compiles a desktop stub that opens an error
dialog instead of the popover. On Linux the popover is a cgo build, so a plain `go install` or a
release archive gives you the CLI and the tray only. Install the headers first, then add the tag
that matches the installed WebKit: `webkit2_41` for 4.1 (Ubuntu 24.04+, Fedora 40+, Arch), nothing
for 4.0 (Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04).

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev # Debian/Ubuntu
npm --prefix cmd/freetokens/web ci
npm --prefix cmd/freetokens/web run build
go build -tags "gui production webkit2_41" ./cmd/freetokens
```

`freetokens diagnose` prints `"popover": true|false`, so you can confirm which front end a binary
was built with before hunting for a window.

The built popover links GTK 3 and WebKit2GTK 4.1, which the same distributions already install for
other applications (`libgtk-3-0` and `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` on Debian/Ubuntu, `gtk3` and
`webkit2gtk4.1` on Fedora). CI compiles this target on every change.

Without `-tags gui`, the same source builds the CGO-free CLI and classic tray. Releases are built
with GoReleaser, which runs the frontend build first.

## Use

```bash
freetokens            # popover when a desktop session exists, otherwise a status report
freetokens tray       # classic tray / menu bar menu
freetokens status     # one-off report; --json for scripts
freetokens autostart on   # on Windows this registers freetokensw.exe
```

```text
$ freetokens status
Freebuff · free
  Daily Hours: 3.5 h left of 5 h · resets in 6h 12m
  Hours Balance: 12 h
  Session 1: 42m left

Tokens (estimated at public API rates)

  Last 30 Days: 700.55M tokens · ~$155.31
```

The screenshots and sample above use demo data.

You need to have signed in once with the Freebuff CLI (`freebuff login`). FreeTokens reads the
CLI's existing `default` profile and never signs in, starts a session, or changes your account. It
looks for the token in these places, in order:

1. `authToken` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/manicode/credentials.json` (Linux and any system that sets
   `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), else in `~/.config/manicode/credentials.json`, or in
   `$FREEBUFF_CONFIG_DIR/credentials.json`.
2. Current Freebuff CLIs store the token in the OS credential store under service `freebuff-cli`:
   the macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or the Secret Service on Linux.
3. `CODEBUFF_API_KEY`.

**Credential prompts.** Background refreshes never show a password or keychain prompt. If the OS
needs your approval, the tray shows a warning. Choose **Refresh Now** (on macOS, **Allow
Access…** in the panel), or run `freetokens status --prompt`, and allow access.

On macOS, choose **Always Allow**. The Keychain ties that approval to the binary's code signature,
and releases are not Developer ID-signed yet, so macOS asks once more after each update.

Freebuff's local history is read-only, and FreeTokens only reads its usage counters and model
fields, never conversation text. The app is an Electron build, so its directory is named after the
product and follows each platform's convention: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Freebuff` on Linux (`~/.config/Freebuff`
when the variable is unset), `~/Library/Application Support/Freebuff` on macOS, and
`%APPDATA%\Freebuff` on Windows — plus the config directory the app and its CLI use on every
platform, where earlier builds wrote `freebuff-desktop`. FreeTokens searches each base directory for
anything named `freebuff…`, then a
few levels below it for SQLite files, and accepts only the ones whose schema has
the app's `messages` and `threads` tables, so Electron's caches and state files are never mistaken
for history. Every usable database under those directories is read; nothing is truncated at a
fixed count. `freetokens diagnose` lists the directories searched and how many databases were
found. Hosted history events other than metrics are skipped without being decoded.

Some Freebuff Desktop installs keep their history in the project instead of the app directory
(`<project>/.freebuff/desktop-v2.db`). FreeTokens doesn't guess where your projects are and never
walks your home directory, so those stores are opt-in: set `FREETOKENS_HISTORY_DIRS` to a
path-list of project roots (or `.freebuff` directories), separated by `:` on macOS and Linux and
`;` on Windows. Without it, only the app's own directories are searched, and the totals below say
nothing about the workspaces that weren't named.

Every local reader keeps only the last 31 days of individual turns, because the panel shows no
period older than 30 days; older turns are dropped as they age out rather than held in memory for
the life of the process.

Antigravity's local stores (`~/.gemini/antigravity*/conversations/*.db`) are also read-only. The
scanner decodes each generation record to keep its token counters, model identity and step
timestamp; prompts and tool payloads are discarded and never stored or sent. A generation is dated
by the step whose token counters match it exactly; when no step matches, the next step's time is
used without claiming that step, so a following generation that does match keeps its measured time.
That is an approximation, so it is labelled as one: when a refresh has to place any generation that
way, the panel says how many of the run's generations were dated at the nearest step and that
Antigravity's per-day split is therefore approximate. The CLI logs the same counts. Antigravity usage is
labeled by source (**Antigravity**, **Antigravity IDE**, or **Agy CLI**) in the model breakdown, and totalled
per source (**Freebuff**, **Antigravity app**, **Antigravity IDE**, **Agy CLI**) above it.

Claude Code's transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`) are read-only too. Only assistant
responses carrying a usage receipt are counted, one turn per message id, so a response split across
content blocks is not counted twice. Input, output, cache-write and cache-read tokens are all
included; prompts, thinking blocks and tool payloads are never kept. Those sessions are labelled
**Claude** in the model breakdown and the per-source summary, because Claude Code can also be pointed
at non-Anthropic models. The Claude desktop app keeps no local token receipts, so only Claude Code
sessions are measured.

Codex's session rollouts (`~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`), written by both the Codex CLI and the
Codex app, are read-only as well. Each `token_usage_record` is one model response, counted once by
response id and labelled **Codex**; sessions from Codex versions that only report a running total
fall back to the per-turn deltas. Codex counts cached input inside its input total, so those are
split out for the cost estimate instead of being counted twice. The rollouts do not distinguish the
CLI from the app, so both are reported under the single **Codex** source.

OpenCode's session database (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode`)
is read-only too. Only `assistant` messages carrying token counters are counted: input, output,
reasoning and cache read/write, where reasoning is reported beside output rather than inside it and
input excludes cache reads. Prompts, tool output and diffs are never kept. Messages are labelled
**OpenCode** in the model breakdown and the per-source summary. OpenCode records the provider of
every message, so that measured vendor is shown even when the model name would suggest another one;
when the recorded id is a gateway or a host rather than a vendor (`openrouter`, `groq`), the model
id decides as it does for Claude and Codex. OpenCode's own Zen models, which no public catalog
lists, are shown as **OpenCode Zen**.

## Updates (opt-in)

FreeTokens never contacts GitHub unless you ask it to. In the macOS app, use **Settings →
Updates**. In the Windows popover, **Settings → Updates** checks for a newer release and links to
it without installing anything. The classic tray keeps the automatic options under **Settings →
Updates from GitHub Releases**:

- **Never Check** (default)
- **Check Daily and Notify** shows an **Install** item when a release is available
- **Check Daily and Install** downloads, verifies and restarts automatically

Or from the CLI:

```bash
freetokens config set auto-update notify   # off | notify | auto
freetokens update --check
freetokens update
```

Each update is checked against the release's `checksums.txt` (SHA-256) before anything is
replaced. The macOS app updates as a whole: the new FreeTokens.app must also pass a code signature
check before it replaces the old one, and then the app relaunches. If FreeTokens is installed
somewhere you can't write, such as a system directory, update it the way you installed it.

## Settings and files

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Settings | the popover gear, the tray's **Settings**, or `freetokens config get` (stored in your OS config directory under `FreeTokens/`) |
| Caches, tray log | the OS cache directory under `FreeTokens/` (e.g. `~/Library/Caches/FreeTokens`) |
| Diagnostics | `freetokens diagnose` prints paths, auth state and numeric quota fields, never tokens |

The popover's **Settings** panel holds the refresh interval, **Start at login**, and the panel theme
(dark by default, or light). The interval and theme also work from the command line:
`freetokens config set refresh-minutes 15` and `freetokens config set theme light`.

## Privacy

FreeTokens sends requests only to:

- `www.codebuff.com`: your session, model catalog and run history, with your token
- `openrouter.ai` and `robinebers.github.io`: public price lists, without your token
- `api.github.com`: release checks, only when you enable updates

Redirects are refused, so your token can't be forwarded to another host. Caches hold no tokens.
The hosted-history cache is keyed by a SHA-256 of the token and is readable only by you.

## Differences from the QuotaBar tracker

The tracker is a port of the Freebuff provider from a QuotaBar fork, and the macOS panel follows
its design. FreeTokens is standalone and covers Freebuff only. Behavior matches the original
tracker, with two exceptions:

- Pricing uses only exact Freebuff routes (the supplement, then OpenRouter). The fuzzy LiteLLM and
  models.dev fallbacks are left out, so some unrecognized models show as unpriced instead of
  getting an approximate price.
- One supplement alias rule uses a regex lookahead that Go can't compile. It covers a Gemini
  model, not a Freebuff route, and is skipped.

## Credits
